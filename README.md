# Project for the course "Proyecto de Desarrollo de Software", where we created an android game.

This is a simple online game, where you compete with friends on who can paint the most cells on the board before the whole board gets painted.
You are a ball who moves by turns around the board, and everytime you step into a cell, it gets painted with your color, and thats how you have to think on the best moves to don't complete the board until you have the most cells on the map painted with your color.
